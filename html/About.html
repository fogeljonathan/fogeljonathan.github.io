            <p>
            I grew up just outside of Philadelphia, PA in a small(ish) town named Springfield. by the time high school came around, I was involved all over the place! I was a varsity wrestler for 4 years, played soccer and lacrosse, a clarinet, and an occasional saxophone, in the school band, and kept busy with my course loads as well.<br>
            
            I went to college at Franklin & Marshall College, where I found my interests in the Physics Major and Mathematics Major. Indecicive, I ended up just completing both majors, and finished my four years in 2021 with a double major in the subjects.<br>
            
            I have worked on two separate research groups within the field of optics. I have presented findings to both internal audiences and research symposiums. In the first of these positions, I was tasked with independently creating a user-friendly program to control the lab's laser system in Python, complete with a graphical user interface, and to characterize the quantum system using frequency-resolved optical gating algorithms. In my next research position, I created and simulated loads on part designs using CAD software such as SOLIDWORKS and COMSOL Multiphysics. Through much of my college experience, I worked with the NANOGrav consortium, where my team analyzed pulsar signals using the Aricebo Radio Telescope, to aid future measurements of gravitational waves. My most recent role was being a House Advisor at Franklin & Marshall College, where I worked closely with students and the school's administration to help solve problems of varying natures. My strong leadership and communication skills have allowed me to excel in this role. Additionally, I have helped facilitate efficient weekly meetings for my colleagues for the length of my years in the position.  <br>

            Since my graduation from Franklin & Marshall College, I have been with MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an Assistant Staff member for the Air, Missile and Maritime Defense Division's Advanced Concepts Group . I have been able to work on many incredibly interesting and exciting problems to benefit US National Security. This role has allowed me to hone my skills in many areas, including Advanced Julia, and Version Control with Git. <br>

            Outside of work, I can found rock climbing, both indoors and out, or playing music at pretty much any given moment. If you have any questions or comments, please refer to the "Contact" tab; I would love to hear what you have to say, especially if you have some suggestions for outdoor climbing spots in Massachusetts!
