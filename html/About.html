            <p>
            I grew up just outside of Philadelphia, PA in the small(ish) town of Springfield, Delaware County.
            I was a varsity wrestler for 4 years of high school, played soccer and lacrosse, played the clarinet and saxophone in the school band, and kept busy with my course loads as well.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This led me to Franklin & Marshall College, where I found my interests in both the Physics Major and Mathematics Major. Indecicive, I ended up just completing both majors, and finished my four years in 2021 with a double major in both subjects.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I have worked on two separate research groups within the field of optics. I have presented findings to both internal audiences and research symposiums. In the first of these positions, I was tasked with independently creating a user-friendly program to control the lab's laser system, complete with a graphical user interface, and to characterize the quantum system using frequency-resolved optical gating algorithms. In my next research position, I created and simulated loads on part designs using CAD software. Through much of my college experience, I worked with the NANOGrav consortium, where my team analyzed pulsar signals using the Aricebo Radio Telescope, to aid future measurements of gravitational waves.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Since my graduation from Franklin & Marshall College, I have been with MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an Assistant Staff member for the Air, Missile and Maritime Defense Division's Advanced Concepts Group. I have been able to work on many incredibly interesting and exciting problems to benefit US National Security. Specifically, my role is within algorithm development/ improvement, and modeling decision-making protocols in wartime scenarios with large-scale simulation.<br>

            <p>
            Outside of work, I can found rock climbing both real rock and in gyms, or playing guitar at pretty much any given moment. If you have any questions or comments, please refer to the "Contact" tab; I would love to hear what you have to say, especially if you have some suggestions for outdoor climbing spots in Massachusetts!
